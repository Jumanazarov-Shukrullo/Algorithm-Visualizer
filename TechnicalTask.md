## Project Title: Algorithm Visualizer

### Project Description:
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various algorithms step by step. The application will provide interactive visual representations of algorithms, aiding users in understanding their behavior and performance.

### Technical Task:

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create a user-friendly frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React.js or Vue.js.
   - Design interactive visualization components to display algorithms in action, allowing users to step through each iteration.
   - Implement features for users to select algorithms, customize input parameters, and control the visualization speed.

2. **Backend Development (Flask):**
   - Set up a Flask application to serve as the backend for the Algorithm Visualizer.
   - Define RESTful API endpoints to handle data retrieval, algorithm execution, and user interactions.
   - Implement algorithms (e.g., sorting algorithms, graph traversal algorithms) as Python functions within the Flask application.
   - Develop endpoints for uploading custom data sets, executing algorithms, and retrieving algorithm results.

3. **Algorithm Visualization:**
   - Create visual representations of algorithms using HTML canvas or SVG elements for dynamic rendering.
   - Implement animation logic to illustrate each step of the algorithm visually, highlighting changes in data structures and variables.
   - Ensure compatibility with different screen sizes and resolutions for a responsive user experience.

4. **Data Management:**
   - Develop functionality to manage data sets (e.g., arrays, graphs) for algorithm visualization.
   - Allow users to upload custom data sets or choose from predefined examples for visualization.
   - Design data structures and algorithms to efficiently handle large data sets and complex scenarios.

5. **User Authentication and Management:**
   - Implement user authentication using Flask-Login or similar libraries to secure user accounts.
   - Create endpoints for user registration, login, logout, and profile management.
   - Enable features for users to save their favorite algorithms, track their progress, and share visualizations with others.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of algorithm implementations and visualization components.
   - Conduct integration testing to validate the interaction between frontend and backend components.
   - Perform usability testing to gather feedback from users and refine the user interface and experience.

7. **Deployment and Scalability:**
   - Containerize the Flask application using Docker for easy deployment and management.
   - Set up a Kubernetes cluster or similar container orchestration platform for scalable deployment.
   - Configure load balancers, auto-scaling, and monitoring tools to ensure optimal performance and availability.

### Deliverables:
- Fully functional Algorithm Visualizer web application with frontend and backend components.
- Documentation covering installation instructions, API documentation, and usage guidelines.
- Test suite with comprehensive unit tests and integration tests.
- Deployment scripts and configurations for Docker and Kubernetes environments.

### Optional Enhancements:
- Support for additional algorithms and data structures.
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub) for collaborative algorithm development.
- Real-time collaboration features to allow multiple users to visualize algorithms together.
- Integration with online educational platforms for sharing algorithm visualizations and tutorials.
